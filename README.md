# Big Data Analysis with Spark (Scala & PySpark)

## Overview
This project analyzes data from the Steam games and their reviews using Apache Spark. The goal is to showcase the power of spark with working on big data. The original analysis was created in Apache Zepelin using Scala. A second PySpark version was created to showcase skills and usability in GitHub

## Data
The dataset consists of Steam game data (publisher, release dates, genres) and review data (playtime, upvotes).

## Methodology
### Step 1: Data Load
- Load in many CSV files into spark and perform joins between different data sets.
### Step 2: Data Cleaning
- Remove missing data and use filtering to narrow down the specific data.
- Engineer new features to improve analysis.
### Step 3: Aggregations & Queries
- Aggregate the filtered data to answer specific questions and get a certain output.
## Results
